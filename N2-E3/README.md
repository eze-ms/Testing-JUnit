# Array Equality Test

## 📄 Description
This Java project uses JUnit 5 to test the equality of integer arrays. It includes test cases to validate when two arrays are identical and provides meaningful feedback if they are not. This project serves as a simple example to demonstrate unit testing concepts in Java.

### Functionality
1. **Core Features:**
    - Validate if two integer arrays are identical.
    - Display a confirmation message when the arrays match.
    - Use JUnit 5 assertions for structured and clear test validations.

2. **Robust Design:**
    - Ensures precise validation of array equality.
    - Implements reusable test cases for various scenarios.
    - Demonstrates basic principles of unit testing in Java.

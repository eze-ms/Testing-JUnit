# Object Reference Tests

## 📄 Description
This Java project uses JUnit 5 and AssertJ to validate object references. It includes tests to demonstrate when two references point to the same object in memory and when they point to different objects. The project highlights memory management concepts and testing best practices.

### Functionality
1. **Core Features:**
    - Validate that two references point to the same object.
    - Validate that two references point to different objects.
    - Use AssertJ for fluent and readable assertions.
    - Leverage JUnit 5 for structured testing.

2. **Robust Design:**
    - Ensures precise validation of object references.
    - Implements clear and reusable test cases.
    - Highlights key concepts of memory and references in Java.
